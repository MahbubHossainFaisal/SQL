    "**Question 01:** \n",
    "How can we count the number of employees whose product of \"months\" and \"salary\" is equal to the maximum value of this product among all employees in the \"Employee\" table? In other words, how can we find out how many employees have the highest monthly earnings?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Employee\n",
    "WHERE months * salary = (SELECT MAX(months * salary) FROM Employee)\n",
    "GROUP BY months, salary;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the query into its individual components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SELECT COUNT(*)`: This part of the query starts by selecting the count of rows from the \"Employee\" table. It's counting the number of rows that meet certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FROM Employee`: This specifies that we are working with the \"Employee\" table, which presumably contains information about employees, including their \"months\" (the number of months they've worked) and \"salary\" (their monthly salary).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `WHERE months * salary = (SELECT MAX(months * salary) FROM Employee)`: This is the condition that filters the rows from the \"Employee\" table. It checks whether the product of \"months\" and \"salary\" for each employee is equal to the maximum product of \"months\" and \"salary\" among all employees. In other words, it finds employees whose earnings for a single month are equal to the highest earnings for a single month among all employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `GROUP BY months, salary`: This part of the query groups the results based on the \"months\" and \"salary\" columns. However, it's important to note that this clause is not necessary for the query's main goal, which is to count the employees who meet the specified condition. Including `GROUP BY` in this context is not required and might not make sense, depending on the database configuration and the nature of the data. The query would work correctly without it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the query essentially counts the number of employees whose monthly earnings are equal to the highest monthly earnings among all employees in the \"Employee\" table. However, the inclusion of `GROUP BY months, salary` might not be necessary for this specific count operation, and it might produce extra groupings that are not needed for the main goal of the query."

    "**Question 02:**\n",
    "What are the approximate sum of latitude and longitude coordinates for the locations represented in the 'STATION' table, rounded to two decimal places?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Query:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N), 2) AS lat, ROUND(SUM(LONG_W), 2) AS lon FROM STATION;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N), 2) AS lat, ROUND(SUM(LONG_W), 2) AS lon`: This part of the query is used to calculate and retrieve specific values from the \"STATION\" table. It involves two calculations:\n",
    "  - `ROUND(SUM(LAT_N), 2)` calculates the sum of all values in the \"LAT_N\" column and rounds the result to two decimal places. The result is given the alias (name) \"lat.\"\n",
    "  - `ROUND(SUM(LONG_W), 2)` calculates the sum of all values in the \"LONG_W\" column and rounds the result to two decimal places. The result is given the alias \"lon.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- `FROM STATION`: This specifies that the data for these calculations should be retrieved from the \"STATION\" table. It assumes that there is a table named \"STATION\" containing information, including latitude (\"LAT_N\") and longitude (\"LONG_W\") data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query essentially performs the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It calculates the sum of all values in the \"LAT_N\" column, which likely represents latitude values for a set of locations.\n",
    "2. It rounds the calculated sum to two decimal places.\n",
    "3. It calculates the sum of all values in the \"LONG_W\" column, likely representing longitude values for the same set of locations.\n",
    "4. It rounds the calculated sum of longitudes to two decimal places.\n",
    "5. It presents the results as \"lat\" and \"lon,\" which represent the summed and rounded latitude and longitude values, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This query is useful when you want to find the approximate center or average coordinates (latitude and longitude) of a set of geographical locations represented by the \"STATION\" table. The rounded values help in presenting the results with a limited number of decimal places for clarity or further analysis."
