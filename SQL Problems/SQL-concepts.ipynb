    "The \"AS\" keyword followed by a name (in this case, \"derived_table_alias\") is used in SQL to assign an alias to a table, subquery, or derived table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "The query within the parentheses represents a subquery or derived table. It is enclosed in parentheses and treated as a temporary table for the outer query.\n",
    "To refer to this temporary table, we assign it an alias using the \"AS\" keyword. The alias is the name that we choose to represent the derived table.\n",
    "The alias provides a shorthand or alternative name for the derived table. It helps simplify the SQL syntax and makes the query more readable.\n",
    "Once the alias is assigned, we can refer to the derived table using its alias in the outer query. This includes selecting columns, performing joins, or applying conditions.\n",
    "In the example query you provided, \"AS derived_table_alias\" assigns the alias \"derived_table_alias\" to the derived table created by the subquery. It allows you to treat the derived table as a regular table and reference it in the outer query.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using aliases, you can improve the readability and maintainability of complex SQL queries, especially when dealing with multiple tables or subqueries."
