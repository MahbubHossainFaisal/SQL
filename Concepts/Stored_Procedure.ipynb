    "A stored procedure is a collection of pre-written SQL queries and commands that are saved in a database. It's a piece of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. You can think of a stored procedure as a reusable script or a mini-program stored within the database itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stored procedures are commonly used in database management systems to automate repetitive tasks, improve efficiency, and enhance security. They encapsulate complex operations or frequently used sequences of actions, allowing you to execute them with a single command rather than writing out all the steps each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of stored procedures include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reusability**: Once a stored procedure is created, it can be used multiple times without rewriting the entire code. This promotes code reusability and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Modularity**: Stored procedures allow you to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. This makes maintenance and troubleshooting easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Performance**: Since stored procedures are stored in the database itself, they can be optimized by the database management system for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Security**: Stored procedures can help control access to sensitive data. Instead of granting direct access to tables, you can grant permission to execute specific stored procedures, ensuring data security.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transaction Management**: Stored procedures can be used to manage transactions, ensuring data integrity in multi-step operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Reduced Network Traffic**: When executing a stored procedure, only a single call needs to be sent to the database server, reducing network traffic compared to sending multiple queries separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Version Control**: Changes to a stored procedure can be managed and version-controlled, improving collaboration among developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, stored procedures are a powerful tool in database systems that simplify the execution of tasks, promote code organization, and enhance overall database performance."

    "**Scenario: Order Processing System**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're developing an online shopping platform. Customers place orders, and these orders need to go through various stages like validation, payment processing, and shipping. Here's how a stored procedure could be useful in this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**: Update the order status to \"Shipped\" and calculate the estimated delivery date when an order is ready to be shipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateOrderStatusAndDeliveryDate(IN orderID INT)\n",
    "AS\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    -- Calculate estimated delivery date (e.g., 3 days from today)\n",
    "    DECLARE @estimatedDeliveryDate DATE;\n",
    "    SET @estimatedDeliveryDate = DATEADD(DAY, 3, GETDATE());\n",
    "\n",
    "    -- Update order status to \"Shipped\" and set the estimated delivery date\n",
    "    UPDATE Orders\n",
    "    SET status = 'Shipped', delivery_date = @estimatedDeliveryDate\n",
    "    WHERE order_id = orderID;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `CREATE PROCEDURE`: We create a stored procedure named `UpdateOrderStatusAndDeliveryDate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `IN orderID INT`: This is an input parameter that the procedure expects. It represents the order ID of the order that needs to be updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `DECLARE @estimatedDeliveryDate DATE;`: We declare a variable `@estimatedDeliveryDate` to store the calculated delivery date.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `SET @estimatedDeliveryDate = DATEADD(DAY, 3, GETDATE());`: We calculate the estimated delivery date by adding 3 days to the current date.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `UPDATE Orders`: We update the `Orders` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `SET status = 'Shipped', delivery_date = @estimatedDeliveryDate`: We set the order's status to \"Shipped\" and update the delivery date with the calculated value.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `WHERE order_id = orderID;`: We restrict the update to the specific order ID passed as a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Usage**:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to mark an order as \"Shipped\" and set its estimated delivery date, you simply call the stored procedure with the order ID:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "EXEC UpdateOrderStatusAndDeliveryDate(123);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This stored procedure simplifies the process of updating the order status and calculating the estimated delivery date. It encapsulates the necessary actions, promotes consistency, and reduces the amount of repetitive code in your application."
