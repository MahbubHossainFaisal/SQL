    "**Concept: UNION in SQL**\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, the `UNION` operator is used to combine the result sets of two or more `SELECT` queries into a single result set. It is important to note that `UNION` only includes distinct rows in the final result. If you want to include all rows, including duplicates, you can use `UNION ALL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the basic syntax for `UNION`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table1\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table2;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's illustrate this with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have two tables, `employees` and `contractors`, with __similar structures__. You want to retrieve a list of all unique names (both employees and contractors) from these two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Query to retrieve unique names from employees\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "\n",
    "UNION\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Query to retrieve unique names from contractors\n",
    "SELECT name\n",
    "FROM contractors;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `UNION` operator combines the results of two separate `SELECT` statements, removing duplicates to provide a list of all unique names from both table."

    "The UNION operator in SQL provides several benefits and use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Combining Results**: UNION allows you to combine the result sets of two or more SELECT queries into a single result set. This is useful when you need to retrieve data from multiple tables or queries and present it as a unified dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Deduplication**: By default, UNION removes duplicate rows from the result set. This means you'll get a list of unique values from the combined queries. If you want to include duplicates, you can use UNION ALL instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: UNION is flexible and can be used in various scenarios, such as merging data from related tables, aggregating data from different sources, or combining results with similar structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Transformation**: It can be used for data transformation tasks where you need to merge or consolidate data from different parts of a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Simplified Reporting**: UNION is often used in reporting to combine data from different tables or databases into a single report, making it easier to analyze and present information.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Efficiency**: When used with appropriate indexing and optimization, UNION can efficiently handle complex data retrieval tasks, reducing the need for multiple queries and improving query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, UNION is a valuable SQL operator that helps consolidate and simplify data retrieval tasks, enabling you to combine results from multiple sources and present them in a unified and structured manner while automatically removing duplicate rows."
